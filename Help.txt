Running the application:

UnZip files and run in visual studio
When prompted for files
Enter: hotels.json
Enter: books.json
You can also give file path your files exist somewhere else but for this demo I have put files booking.json and hotels.json in the default folder reservation\bin\Debug\net8.0
Enter for availability test:
Availability(H1, 20240901, SGL) 
Availability(H1, 20240901-20240903, DBL)
Enter for Search Test:
Search(H1, 365, SGL)
Enter on blank prompt for exit
